rem This script performs the actions that are required before building the solution file
rem src\Everything.sln. These actions are broken out into a separate script, rather than
rem being performed inline in BuildAndTest.cmd, because AppVeyor cannot run BuildAndTest.
rem AppVeyor only allows you to specify the project to build, and a script to run before
rem the build step. So that is how we have factored the build scripts.
