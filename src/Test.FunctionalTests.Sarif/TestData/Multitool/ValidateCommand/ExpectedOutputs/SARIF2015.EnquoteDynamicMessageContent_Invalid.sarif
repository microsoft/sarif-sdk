It's especially helpful when the dynamic content is a string that might contain spaces, and most especially when the string might be empty (and so would be invisible if it weren't for the quotes). We recommend single quotes for a less cluttered appearance, even though US English usage would require double quotes.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a set of authoring practices that make your rule messages more readable, understandable, and actionable. See also 'SARIF2001.TerminateMessagesWithPeriod' and 'SARIF2014.ProvideDynamicMessageContent'."
