The stack protector (/GS) is a security feature of the compiler which makes it more difficult to exploit stack buffer overflow memory corruption vulnerabilities. The stack protector requires access to entropy in order to be effective, which means a binary must initialize a random number generator at startup, by calling __security_init_cookie() as close to the binary's entry point as possible. Failing to do so will result in spurious buffer overflow detections on the part of the stack protector.

ASLR compatibility mode reduces the number of locations to which ASLR may relocate the binary, reducing its effectiveness at mitigating memory corruption vulnerabilities. To resolve this issue, either use the default preferred base address by removing any uses of /baseaddress from compiler command lines, or /BASE from linker command lines (recommended), or configure your program to start at a base address above 4GB when compiled for 64 bit platforms (by changing the constant passed to /baseaddress or /BASE).
